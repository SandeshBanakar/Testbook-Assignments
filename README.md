# Testbook-Assignments
The repository contains all HTML files with codes that are related to the assignments given by Testbook.
The HTML files are submitted using Google Forms. Please do not change codes unnecessarily. I have my time in it.

The HTML files are coded to solve any assignment from Testbook's free HTML Beginner Course.

You can also access the course using their website. I really do not know how to write README file.

If you want to suggest an easy way, or new things for me to learn, please do so by sending an email to isandeshbanakar@gmail.com

THANKS!
